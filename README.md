# Personal build of DWM

## Patches
* [Vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/ "vanitygaps")  
Inspired by some of the functionality of i3-gaps this patch adds (inner) gaps between client windows and (outer) gaps between windows and the screen edge in a flexible manner.
* [Swallow](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/ "swallow")  
This patch adds "window swallowing" to dwm as known from Plan 9's windowing system rio.
* [Pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/ "pertag")  
More general approach to taglayouts patch. This patch keeps layout, mwfact, barpos and nmaster per tag.
* [Fibonacci](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fibonacci/ "fibonacci")  
This patch adds two new layouts (spiral and dwindle) that arranges all windows in Fibonacci tiles: The first window uses half the screen, the second the half of the remainder, etc.
* [Systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/ "systray")  
A simple system tray implementation. Multi-monitor is also supported. The tray follows the selected monitor.
